!IMPORTANT!

If you add new files here, you will have to also include them in the iOS XCode project, in HTMLTemplateFilenames.plist, as well as adding the references to the correct group:

1.) In the sidebard showing the project file hierarchy, right click on the correct group within 'HTML'.
2.) 'Add files to protogrid'
3.) Choose the file you want to add in the file picker window.
4.) IMPORTANT: Do *NOT* choose the option, 'Copy  items if needed', 'Added folders' option needs to be set to 'Create groups'.
